#this is a program that will try to familiarize you with lists and tuples.

#lists can be declared by using square brackets '[]' and can have data added and removed from them.
Alist = [1,2,3,4]

#lists can also be empty.
Emptylist = []

#tuples are like lists, exept that they are declared by using parenthesis '()' and cant have any data added and removed from them.
Atuple = (5,6,7,8)

#most programming languages (including python) start counting from 0.
#the print statment below will print the first value from 'Alist', which is 1.
print(Alist[0])
